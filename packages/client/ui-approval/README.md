## Summary

Browser approval presentation over the Agent-scoped Remote Event waterfall. Each pending request appears as a compact card in the `conversation.pending` slot after the transcript and before the composer, outside folded Tool rows. A new card scrolls into view without taking keyboard focus. The ordinary input and its draft stay mounted; there is no waiting strip or secondary review button. The reason, scope and action buttons remain visible; operation details expand on demand. Reject and Allow once settle the same scoped Host request.

-----

Focus the approval detail region to approve with Enter or reject with Escape. The mounted plugin reserves both keys against editable shortcuts. Enter on the focused Reject button retains its native reject action. The operation-details disclosure keeps its native Enter action. Input controls and IME candidates keep their own keys. Keyboard and pointer actions share one pending-request lock; a withdrawn or replaced request cannot accept another answer, and an earlier failed answer cannot unlock its replacement.

When offered, **Always allow** is the highlighted primary button. Otherwise, the current-request allow action is primary. Enter in the detail region always grants the limited scope: once for a tool approval, or the current session for CUA. Persistent access requires explicitly activating Always allow. The shortcut reference uses Allow because the caller supplies that scope.

## Model Experience

None, as this package presents approval requests in the browser and registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; approval request and response rendering does not alter a model request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- The shared `conversation.approval.card` Factory presents reject, allow and an optional always-allow action, with caller-owned scope, subject metadata and answer callbacks. Tool approvals retain their two outcomes. Application consent can reuse the card without adopting tool-approval policy. Subject metadata enables left-aligned content and wrapping actions; callers that omit it retain inherited alignment and a single action row. Icons and labels identify the subject visually; the caller owns identity verification and saved grants.
